# Ecosystem Project

This is the Ecosystem Project from the book "The Nature of Code" by Daniel Shiffman. 
I will develop a set of rules for simulating the real-world behavior of a creature, building on top of principles from the random walk or other noise-driven motions. 
The first step is to simulate a jittery bug that flies in unpredictable ways. 

The goal is to build an ecosystem based on the topics covered in the book. Watching how the illustration evolves in each subsequent chapter as new concepts and techniques are introduced.
